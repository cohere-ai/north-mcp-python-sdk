##### Channel Guidelines

1. Corporate & Internal Emails

What to keep in mind:

- Email can be a very efficient way of communicating to a broad range of audiences.
- It can also be difficult to ‘break through the clutter’ of emails sent every day.
- To make things easier for your readers, always communicate succinctly using a simple subject line call to action and closing.

  **Do's**
  - Use a clear subject line.
  - Address the reader in a personal and welcoming way (instead of ‘Dear all’ you use ‘Dear Yousef’).
  - Show empathy, especially when delivering bad news or urgent reminders.
  - Keep it short.
  - End your email with something that activates your reader (e.g. ‘Go to our website for…’).

  **Don’ts**
  - Sound cold or distant.
  - Be ‘excessive’ in detail.
  - Write long paragraphs when bullet points or short sentences can make the point.
  - Write one long text instead of clear paragraphs with a headline.

1. Corporate website

What to keep in mind:

- Tens of thousands of people interact with our website every day. It’s the first place all of our audiences will look to find information about us.
- When writing for our website, the most important thing is to make it easy for visitors to navigate through your website and find what they’re looking for. Quickly, easily and intuitively.

  **Do's**
  - Use clear headlines, subheads and captions to help readers skim through information.
  - Write in first and second person (we at stc / you and stc).
  - Include meaningful proof points to support claims.
  - Use approachable, human language – it’s our first point of contact.
  - Balance text with images, video, and infographics to engage the viewer and show our work and innovations.

  **Don’ts**
  - Overload pages with heavy blocks of text. Keep it open and clear.
  - Use language that contradicts our brand expression principles. Talk like a human, less like a business.
  - Use excessive business jargon or overly technical language.

1. Print & Broadcast Advertising

What to keep in mind:

- Catching people’s attention and making them aware of who we are and what we stand for is the essence of great print advertising.
- Use an enthusiastic voice and tell engaging stories that speak to the benefits of the work we’re doing.

  **Do's**
  - Catch the reader’s attention with an evocative, impactful headline.
  - Use simple words that are easily understood: speak like our audience speaks.
  - Keep things clear: just one key thought, one key ‘take-away’.
  - Direct the reader to our website for more information.

  **Don’ts**
  - Overwhelm readers with too much information or details.
  - Try to say everything we are and do in one ad.
  - Include generic details that don’t apply to our audience: what they care about or aspire to achieve.
  - Use stories and images that don’t relate to the target’s daily reality.

1. Annual Report & Government Communications

What to keep in mind:

- Reports, comms to government entities and business newsletters need to communicate the scope and focus of our work.
- As well as the impact we have at the service of progress and prosperity that enriches lives.
- Speak confidently and enthusiastically but with the solid credibility and proof-point detail that readers expect from formal documents.

  **Do's**
  - Use our personal voice at all times.
  - Structure with clear paragraphs and titles.
  - Use emotion to engage with readers.
  - Provide short and clear explanations when introducing business information and explaining strategic initiatives.
  - Provide detailed information or annexes for readers looking for in-depth detail (e.g. Regulators, Financial Markets, Government).
  - Use graphs and images to illustrate key points in text.

  **Don’ts**
  - Clutter pages with too much content and words.
  - Use official, formal language. We’re still the same friendly, enthusiastic sender.
  - Lead with detail that might confuse readers.
  - Repeat or contradict information you’ve already provided previously.

1. Social Media

What to keep in mind:

- ocial media is a powerful tool for delivering quick, concise messages. It’s important that our content is always interesting, timely and easily understood.
- This will encourage audiences to engage with us to learn more about who we are and what we do. And gives us an opportunity to engage with our audiences in an informal way.

  **Do's**
  - Use contractions (e.g. we’ll).
  - Always ‘speak’ positively (e.g. ‘Keep going instead’ of ‘Don’t stop’).
  - Use informal, every day language.
  - Use short words and sentences.
  - Use hashtags selectively for concepts we want to be associated with (e.g. enjoyment, enrichment and fulfilling greater opportunities).

  **Don’ts**
  - Use overly colloquial or ‘forced’ language.
  - Use trendy abbreviations.
  - Try to use street slang or jargon.
  - Express your personal views: remember it’s stc speaking.
  - Use ALL CAPS as this can be alarming online.

1. SMS Messages

What to keep in mind:

- SMS messages are useful for sending quick and short messages for reminders, promotions and notifications to customers and employees. - It’s essential that the messages you send are short, simple and focused. If relevant, include a call-to-action to engage your audience.

  **Do's**
  - Use contractions (e.g. we’ll).
  - Use simple, every day language.
  - Be short and concise: the shorter the better.
  - Keep it personal: even in a short message.
  - Be clear: one key thought, one key ‘take-away’ per message.
  - Use call-to-action to activate and engage your audiences.

  **Don’ts**
  - Use abbreviations – look for short words instead.
  - Sound cold or distant.
  - Overwhelm audiences with details.
  - Use SMS to replace other channels of communication.
  - Overwhelm with many messages

   2. Chat with documents: Transform the way you interact with information by chatting with your files and custom tools to get reliable answers grounded in your data.
   3. Create and customize agents: Create AI agents tailored for specific projects or tasks, and share them with team members.

   **Chat**
   ai core delivers a conversational experience that accelerates your work. It allows for open-ended, context-aware conversations, meaning you can ask anything and receive detailed answers grounded in your uploaded data.
   A core function is the chat interface that enables you to quickly get information, eliminating the need to manually sift through various files.

   Using chat, you can easily:
   1. Summarize information: Turn long-form materials, such as meeting transcripts, reports, or documents, into clear, concise summaries.
   2. Generate and refine content: Draft new content or refine existing copy, from a quick email to a polished report or presentation outline.
   3. Chat with documents: Ask questions and extract insights directly from uploaded documents.
   4. Analyze data: Uncover insights and visualize results using data from attached files.
   5. Chat Using Web Search: Activating the Web search capability allows the agent to access up-to-date information from the internet. This is particularly useful for questions about current events or topics and data that are not contained within your internal documents.
   6. Chat Using Data Interpreter: The Data interpreter is a powerful capability that utilizes the Python console and is designed for data analysis and computation. Once enabled, it allows the agent to execute code to perform a variety of tasks on your behalf. 6.1 Use this capability to: Perform complex calculations. Analyze data from uploaded files (e.g., csv, xlsx). Generate charts and visualizations based on data.
   7. Verifying Answers with Citations: To ensure responses are trustworthy and grounded in facts, ai core provides direct answers and shows you the exact evidence backing them up. This transparency allows you to instantly verify claims and dig deeper into the source material. 7.1 How Citations Appear and Work: Instead of a numbered marker, any statement in a response that is backed by a source is visually highlighted (e.g., rendered in bold and a different color). This makes it easy to see which parts of the response are directly supported by data. 7.2 When you click on the highlighted text: A pop-up window appears, displaying the source of the information. Inside the pop-up, you can review the snippet from the source that supports the claim (e.g., a page in a PDF). If multiple sources back up the statement, you can browse through all of them. To view the full document or webpage in its original context, simply click the source title in the pop-up, and it will open in a new tab.
   8. Conversation sharing: Chat sessions can be shared with other ai core users via a secure link. This allows you to collaborate or review.

   **AI Agent**
   An agent is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users by processing natural language inputs (e.g., questions or prompts), retrieving information, automating tasks, and providing intelligent responses based on context. Agents may support users directly through chat interfaces or operate behind the scenes within automated workflows.

   There are two types of agents in ai core:
   1. Default agent: This is a ready-to-use agent that is available in ai core for each user. The default agent is private to you, cannot be shared with others. When you start a new conversation from the central chat bar on Home, it is with your default agent.
   2. Custom agent: This is a user-created agent often built for a specific task. Custom agents can be private or shared with specific users. To build a custom agent, you must select a model, enable tools to define the agent’s abilities (files, capabilities, custom instructions), and determine who can access it.

   Viewing the Agent’s Thinking Process:
   Agents display their reasoning as a thinking trace, which is a series of steps taken to generate a response. Depending on the underlying model, these traces may be longer or shorter. This transparency helps you understand how the agent achieves its answer.

   How to View the Thinking Trace:
   After the agent has responded, click the downward arrow next to "Response complete" to expand the full trace. This will display each step the agent took, making it easy to follow its decision-making process.

   **Functionalities/Tools Available in ai core**
   1. My files (Standard): Upload files directly from your device to ai core. These files can be used by agents in chats, connected to specific agents, and highlighted for prompts. Includes support for deletion, duplicate handling. (supports file uploads up to 50 MB)
